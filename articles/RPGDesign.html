                    <p>I’ve always loved RPGS. Most other game genres tend to be rigidly defined. Shooters? You shoot things.
                         Fighting games? You use your attacks in sequence, attempting to create combos and rack up damage. 
                         But RPGs? RPGS can be anything. In Action RPGs, you pull out your weapons and duke it out in real time. 
                         Others, like D&D, Baldur's Gate, and Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, transition you seamlessly into combat, using turns as a stand-in for time. 
                         Many JRPGs, like Pokémon, imagine combat as you and your opponent selecting abilities in sequence. 
                         Other games, like Wizard 101, imagine combat as a card game. Dread forces its participants to play Jenga. 
                         There is no formula, no defined design process. The mechanics are completely at the discretion of the developer.</p>

                    <p>Being an avid player of D&D, I have always been obsessed with turn based combat. 
                        For years, I have strived to concoct the perfect tabletop combat system, one that allows for rewarding, 
                        strategic experience in an hour or less. While this mythical, flawless experience alludes me, developing 
                        enjoyable but imperfect games has allowed me to hone my craft and taught me much about game design.
                        My first foray was an arena-battle board game called <a href="FallOfExxinon.pdf">"Fall of Exxinon.”</a> 
                        In this game, players selected a pre-made character and were able to move around a map, using abilities 
                        and casting spells from a shuffled deck of cards. Choosing the best spell from the limited options in a 
                        hand was fun, but what was the most entertaining for players was the delayed payoff certain spells had. 
                        A number of spells would allow players to designate an area on the map where the spell would take effect in a few turns. 
                        This simple mechanic added a bit of planning, positioning, and teamwork that elevated the experience dramatically.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>Building off of this idea, I ran a modified D&D campaign for my friends that tried to integrate the variance and strategy 
                    from “Fall of Exxinon.” This did not work as well. Combat is generally a small subset of the D&D experience, so the complexity 
                    that deepened the board game served to create a massive time pit. Each turn of combat took forever, with players agonizing over
                    their decisions, checking with their team before committing to a plan, and then realizing that they missed something, 
                    and having to start all over again. The system was manageable for 2v2  combat, but became bloated and overly complex with 5 players plus enemies. 
                    There were benefits, however. Players did feel engaged with the combat, even those who normally checked out in regular D&D. 
                    Additionally, it allowed me to greatly simplify combat design, as even a walking health bar was still strategically interesting for the players.
                    Despite it’s flaws, it did lead to the greatest RPG character of all time, Bright Obelisk. This character was unable to cast spells normally,
                    instead relying on his powers of prediction. For his action, he could cast a spell face down, (unknown to me, the DM, or other players at the table).
                    Each spell had a condition, such as “If you are damaged by an enemy…” or “If the DM says a word with exactly 13 letters…” 
                    If the condition was fulfilled, they were able to immediately activate a powerful effect, but if two turns passed, they would have to discard the spell.
                    This led to a lot of extremely fun scenarios, for the players and for me. He had fun bluffing cards to make me play around them, 
                    and the other players had fun trying to work to fulfill his conditions. This made the gameplay very dynamic and interesting, 
                    as anytime a card was face down, everyone at the table was excited to see what would happen. The character had an additional, 
                    secret power that permanently increased their health anytime they made the whole table laugh, which just added to their aura. 
                    Despite combat taking forever, it was still an absolute blast. I later reiterated on this combat system, attempting to speed 
                    it up by forcing a linear turn order, reducing the number options players had, and improving the visibility and accessibility of information,
                     but combat still ended up taking too long. Someday, I may finally develop the courage to add a timer to combat, or design enemy encounters that are
                      interesting enough to stand on their own, but until then I will continue tinkering.</p>

                    <p>Another RPG that I worked on was called <a href="LivingLandsPRINT.pdf">“The Living Lands.”</a> In this RPG, magic overflows the land, 
                        causing mutations in players that strengthen their connection and reliance on the land. Characters are stronger when in their favored environment,
                        allowing for positioning to be important, even in social encounters. Instead of a class system, players were only limited as to what
                        they could use by their bond with the land. Overall, this system was very flavorful and fun. As a player, social interaction felt fun and impactful,
                        and combat was exciting and engaging. Like many of my previous systems, the depth of strategy was a little overwhelming for new players,
                        but simultaneous turns helped keep them engaged. From a game host standpoint, this game was FAR easier to design combats for than D&D.
                        I devised a “zone-based” system, in which a drawing or image could be divided into nebulously shaped zones of ‘approximately the same size.’ 
                        No tools or detailed miniatures necessary, just quickly create a battle map using pen and paper. This also drastically reduced the prep time for impromptu combat.
                        The main issue with the system was that players who happened to be attuned to the current setting tended to be stronger than those who weren’t. 
                        While my team thought this would be mechanically interesting, some players did not enjoy feeling like they “chose the wrong biome.”</p>
