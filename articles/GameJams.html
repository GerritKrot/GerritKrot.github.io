                    <p>Minutes to Meltdown, in it's current state, is a very atmospheric but rather confusing game in which you,
                        a nuclear engineer, must prevent reactor meltdown by repairing various components as they break. 
                        As you travel between rooms, an amorphous, radioactive blob will chase you. 
                        Looking directly at the creature, affectionally dubbed "Fweti," causes your screen to fill up with colorful static, mimicing how radition interferes with digital camera signals.
                        Being too close to the creature will cause the player to succumb to radition poisoning, so navigating the labyrithine tunnels quickly is critical to ensure survival.
                        After surviving for long enough without allowing a meltdown, the player is victorious.</p>

                    <p>Minutes to Meltdown was an interesting project to work on. 
                        The team created for this project originally consisted of two programmers, two sound designers, four professional artists, a UI/UX designer, a producer, and a few other helpers.
                        Unfortunately, the other programmer was unable to contribute much due to unforseen circumstances, so I was tasked with implementing most of the game myself.
                        Being the only programmer on a weeklong game jam is already a little daunting, especially when supporting such a large and talented group of artists.
                        Of course, we had to downscope the project dramatically, but almost all of the important features made it in. 
                        The narrative component was removed, and a large amount of UI went unimplemented, leaving most players rather confused on what to do.
                        I'm particularly dissapointed that I was unable to implement the UI, since our UI/UX developer put in a herculean effort and, 
                        during the course of the project, learned basic Unity Development to implement the UI himself to reduce my workload. (Thank you, Kris!)
                        Since this project is, in my approximation, pretty dang cool, and the other people behind it worked incredibly hard,
                        I have continued working on it, and will be correcting these issues soon.</p>
